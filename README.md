Data science models created and deployed for Climatology data in my internship for IISER Pune.

BERT Model for Tweet Analysis- We load the dataset and define a simple text classification model to infer the sentiment of tweets regarding Global Warming. We run 4 epochs and we can see that the accuracy for the model improves with almost 30% per epoch. It goes from 44% to 72% and then to a staggering 92% in the 3rd epoch itself. The 4th epoch however gives us an amazing accuracy of 98% ! Thus BERT's claim at being the best NLP algorithm holds true!
